# PLATO
PLATO was earlier named as Potato Leaf Analysis Testing and Operation is now changed to Plant Leaf Analysis Testing and Operation. 
In this project I am developing an image recognition tool to detect the anomalies in different plants and detect diseases through CNN and image processing.
It is a robust Deep Learning project which aims to provide better solutions and reduce crop wastage.
Till now models based on potato leaf analysis, Plumeria and sweet lime have been added and more are in the pipeline. 
They have been deployed into a website using React JS.
